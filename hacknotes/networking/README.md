## Defense Against Network Attack
In defending against network attack, there are broadly speaking four sets of available tools:

1. **Management** — keeping your systems up-to-date and configured in ways that will minimise the attack surface.
2. **Filtering** — the use of firewalls to stop bad things like Trojans and network exploits, and to detect signs of attack and compromise if anything gets through.
3. **Intrusion Detection** — having programs monitoring your networks and machines for signs of malicious behaviour.
4. **Encryption** — protocols such as TLS and SSH that enable you to protect specific parts of the network against particular attacks.
