Notes and advice for mindset as a developer and hacker from htb


### Simplicity

The most straightforward theory is preferable to all others of several sufficient possible explanations for the same state of facts. In other words: The simplest explanation is always the most probable.

The simplest explanation for the best approach to testing is that we work with the information we can get.

Efficiency depends not only on the quality of information we find but on the usage of that information.

information we collect has a certain level of quality, but not all information is helpful. More than that, some information can confuse and disorient us completely. To learn to discern such information, we need a repertoire which we collect by practicing. Therefore, it is essential to understand the context of the topic we are researching.


### The importance of goal settings
90 percent of people are significantly more successful in achieving their dreams by setting challenging and specific goals.

Once we know the goal (The Goal) to which we are attracted (Willingness), we can use various principles, such as the Pareto Principle or Occam's Razor, to develop our talents (Talent) and skills and make our decisions (Decision Making) to pass the obstacles that fall across our path by asking the right questions (Questioning).

No matter what goal we have in mind, we must decide on it.

Because the decision of what goal we want to achieve influences how we learn, a task or goal helps us influence how we think.

How to reach the goal? If we think about it few successful people are able to say that they knew exactly what path that would lead them to their goal beforehand. What they do know for certain, is the goal that they had set for themselves.


### Problems

A problem is an emotional state. Without emotions, it is just a situation.

The only thing we have to do is to add the word "*yet*."
	* I cannot do this "*yet*."
	* This is not for me "*yet*."
	* I do not understand this "*yet*."

Progress is noticeable when the question that tortured us has lost its meaning.

However, first of all, we have to fail. It is an unavoidable and essential part of learning. This is one of the parts of the learning process which make us successful. Experience is built on failures. It explains that we know how to handle differently. Sometimes adverse, situations where something does not work as expected.


### Problem Solving

Solving a problem can require creativity

it is necessary to put our brain into a different "mode," forcing our brain to function differently. A specific category of activity that forces our brain to behave differently is called creativity.

The reason is that we force the brain to invent something new. At the same time, we cannot focus on the mindset while developing something new as this requires completely different thought processes than dealing with a task.

we use the information we already have. The art of thinking, called "Outside the box," is an essential part of the "hacker mindset",

Thinking outside the box means seeing things outside of the limitations placed on us

once you solve a problem, it is important to:
* think about how many different ways are there to solve it
* think about why you didn't solve the problem in a different way.
* think about the reasons for choosing the method that you chose

it is crucial to train the eye to notice even the most minor details. All our knowledge and experiences are based on associations that connect us with different perceptions, such as colors, smells, etc. These will be recalled later either actively or passively.


### Making better documentation


The primary and most difficult objective we must overcome is the combination of our knowledge, adaptation, and new information.

We have to understand how things work, how they are structured, and how to use them. All of the technical information we need to be successful in this field is already out there.

Purpose of documentation is to present the information we have obtained in a comprehensible and easy way to reproduce a specific activity.

Therefore the essential characteristics of documentation are:
	1. Overview
	2. Structure
	3. Clarity

information we collect has a certain level of quality, but not all information is helpful. More than that, some information can confuse and disorient us completely. 

When writing docs:   
  1. position yourself as a reader
  2. Avoid repetition and ambiguity.
  3. Make documentation as easy to read as possible.

### Learning faster

It often is not easy to find the information we need. First, we have to find out what kind of information we need.
	* What do we already know?
	* What do we not know yet?

When reading new information, an individual process is started, there is an initial reaction to an external information's influence, and then we imagine/interpret and process/link to our own existing knowledge.

We learn what we need, how to use it, and how to work with it. We will see what kind of things can happen, collect our first practical experience, and improve our existing skills

Moreover, the we can now learn all of the theoretical aspects more in-depth through practice and repetition.

To be good at something means we know what we are doing. If we know what we are doing, that means that we are experienced with this topic. Experience means we have a vast repertoire in this field. Repertoire comes from associations and practical experience. When we say practical experience, we want to know how much we have to practice to become competent at a specific task.


### Questioning

A right question is a precise question that allows us to establish the relationships between the components, to understand them, and to take us one step further to the required answer.

Relational Oriented Questioning Model represents five components:

Your Position - This describes the position we are in and our view.
The  Object - The object is the core element of the question. The main component of our sentence takes the meaning out of the question.
Known - This information is known to us.
Unknown -This information is not known to us.
Other Position(s) - This component describes the position of other persons.


###### states for a question
We can assign two states, rough or precise, to a question:
	* A rough question would be: "How can I hack X?"
	* A precise question would be: "How can I use the server's SMB service to identify its existing user accounts?"

###### Describing relationships between components
1. Connection - How is X connected to Y?
2. Affection - How does Y influence the state of component X?


### Getting Stuck


An inexperienced woodcutter takes 30 minutes to sharpen his axe and 3 hours to cut down the tree.

The experienced one will sharpen the axe for 3 hours and cut down the tree within 30 minutes.

Therefore, it is essential to understand the context of the topic we are researching and it is essential to pay attention to details that appear unimportant at first glance

What happens when we get stuck? There are many ways that we become "stuck". It could be that we focused too much and lost the context of the task at hand, or we are tired and did not take enough breaks. 

We know that one person cannot know everything. In this case, we have to learn how to find, choose, learn, and adapt the information we need.

To filter such information, we need a repertoire which we collect by practicing.


### Productivity

Focusing is the purposeful and deliberate alignment to a specific goal.

If we know our goal, it is easier to align our focus accordingly. 

Attention is influenced by your interests, needs, personal attitudes, beliefs, orientations, goals, and experiences.

When we leave the so-called comfort zone, we enter a situation or field where we have little or no experience. This kind of uncertainty lowers our ability to think and has a powerful impact on our thought processes, which, in turn, slows us down.

* small children do not exhibit such uncertainty 

* They love to try out something new all the time and are not afraid or uncertain of making mistakes.

Mistakes are an essential part of the learning process, and we should always keep it in mind.

Those who chose to leave the comfort zone would reach their destination faster than they thought they would. They would never have sprinted at such speed before in their lives.

Now we should understand the progression between decisions to step out of our comfort zone or stay in it. We will often get into situations where we do not know what to do. These will come again and again. However, we will always learn something new, and it will become more comfortable each time.
