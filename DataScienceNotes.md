Look at mean, medium, mode


Also look at categorical data, numerical data and ordinal data - mixing of numerical and categorical data


Numerical data, discrete data, and continuos data

Median - middle value of a sorted list
Mode - most common value
Mean - average





————————


 range: Max value - smallest value 

domain: is all values your data points can take on 

——
Variance: is distance away from mean value so ( mean(n_elements_array) - n_element = n_variance ) 

Standard deviation : square root of the variance

Knowing the range of your data is in gives you information on how closely your grouped your data set is

Correlation and causation

Covariance: how much one value varies when the other value varies

Correlation: covariance  divide by the standard deviation of each variable


Correlation does not imply causation 

Correlation of 1 (positively correlated): when one goes up, the other goes with it 

Correlation between 0 and 1: when one goes up, the other tends to go with it (more so close much less so close to o) 

Correlation of O: one variable changing has no effect on the other (at least not linear)

 Correlation between 0 and -1: when one goes up, the other tends to go down (more SO close much less so close to o) 

Correlation of -1 (negatively correlated): when one goes down, the other goes up


Between -1 and 1

Quadrant percentiles aka quantiles - split data into four equal regions to give your quartiles, look at the top 25 and bottom 25

Percentile divide graph Into a 100

Visualizing data

- Use understanding of system and reasoning
- Use outside knowledge
- See potential trends and patterns,
- Consider the context of the data

——————
One variable graphs:

Histogram - show the distribution of the data across all the values contained in our data, see where the data is concentrated and see how its distributed, show behavior of data - descriptions: Gaussian like, exponentially decaying, two peaks - good for range and domain.  good for mode



Bar plots - allow us to the compare the same variable across different groups,
Ex: control vs test groupes, tax rates of different countries, male vs female height  - good for variance -. medium and nice


Pie chart - split data into pie charts and see sections of what the data is made up of - good for percentiles - examples, ethnicity distribution, star reviews. For a product


—————


Two variable graphs:

Scatter charts  - spread of data between two variables, allow to see dense and sparse areas, correlations and trends can be found, each data point is shown on the graph as a point

Income vs years of education
Travel time vs distance travel
Sales vs cost for cars

Sales vs rating



Line graphs - similar to scatter plots but points are connected, easier to see trends, useful if you want to see evolution,Great if consecutive data points are related
-ex: Distance vs time, Profit versus number of employees, Creativity vs stress



2d histograms - allow you to see distribution of two variables relative to each other, allow you to see where both variables clump and how one falls of relative to other at specific points, hard to see scatter plots because they sit on top of each other



Box and whisper plot - allows you to see spread of data, show spread of data with quartiles, and medium
Filters are out statical information and shows it visually,
Can be compared across difference groupes like bar plots

——
Three and higher variable graphs:


Heat maps


Multi variable bar plots


Add more variable to lower dimensional graphs
